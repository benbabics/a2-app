                    Supplemental Information: We may supplement the information that you provide with additional information we receive from third parties, including service providers, credit bureaus and industry trade groups.

                </p>

                <h3>How we use the information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                    WEX uses the information you provide in connection with a Card Program application for the specific purpose of evaluating your creditworthiness with regard to such application, as well as to collect and verify certain information which is required by lending or banking laws for us to create an account for you. WEX may also use the information that you provide, such as your postal/mailing address and/or email address, to send you promotions or solicitations for products or services. Information collected through our database technology in connection with incomplete online applications is used to gauge your interest in our products and to assist us in our marketing efforts and our ability to better serve our customers. We use transaction data gathered when you use your Card for the purpose of processing the transactions. The transaction data is critical to our ability to provide billing and reporting to you. Depending on the Card Program that you have chosen, you may have paper, electronic or online billing and reporting options. In addition, we may use transaction information that we collect from our customers for marketing or other promotional purposes. If you have provided information to us as part of an information request, WEX may use that information to assist in responding to your request or collect such information for marketing or other promotional purposes. WEX uses the information collected as a result of our third-party web tracking software (including Google Analytics â€“ see
                    <a ng-click=vm.openUrl("https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/")>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time) to help diagnose problems with our server, to track user traffic patterns, and to administer our website/app. This information allows us to determine which areas are of most interest and use to our visitors, which avenues of site promotion are most effective and at what time we can expect peak usage. WEX may use aggregated application information or transaction data for internal and external analytical purposes, including marketing purposes. However, aggregated information and data will not be identified with any particular applicant, individual customer or individual cardholder.
                </p>
                <h3>With whom we share the information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                    Our employees have access to the information that we collect from you. All employees of WEX are required to maintain and keep all such information confidential and to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. WEX may from time to time retain the services of third-party technical service providers and consultants. These third parties are only allowed access to the information that we collect to the extent that is required for them to perform the tasks for which they were retained. These third parties are contractually obligated to maintain confidentiality and further must agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. WEX has agreements with certain companies (such as fuel providers or vehicle leasing companies) to offer co-branded and private label charge card programs. If you participate in one of our co-branded or private label card programs, specific information about you and/or your account may be shared with the sponsor of the card program that you have elected to use for your card provider. For example, WEX performs credit adjudication services on behalf of some of these program sponsors. In these instances, WEX may submit application processing status reports to the program sponsor. These status reports are intended to measure our performance on behalf of the program sponsor and contain limited customer information. These reports do include the name of the customer, the date(s) that the customerâ€™s application was reviewed, whether the application was approved or denied, and may include comments detailing actions taken or expected to be taken to complete the review of the application. If a customer uses a co-branded or private label card, the program sponsor is given limited access to transaction data that allows them to determine what products are purchased by the customer and to tailor their services accordingly. In connection with the adjudication of any credit application, we may disclose the information contained in the application to credit bureaus, credit references and other sources disclosed by the applicant for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness and verifying the identity of the applicant. Furthermore, we reserve the right to provide information related to our own business relationship with you to credit bureaus or related sources. WEX utilizes third party collection agencies to assist us in recovering against delinquent accounts. We disclose only that information that is necessary for such collection agencies to perform the services for which they were hired. Such information routinely includes the name, address and phone number of the accountholder, account balance, payment history, and details concerning previous internal collection efforts. Subject to applicable legal restrictions, WEX may share certain information that we have collected about our commercial customers to third parties for marketing purposes if we reasonably believe that such third parties can offer products or services that would be beneficial to those customers. We do not rent or sell your email address to third parties. WEX may disclose or exchange with third parties any information that you have provided to us if we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so or if it is necessary to protect the rights or property of WEX or our users. Additionally, as we continue to grow as a business, we may acquire or be acquired by another company. In such a transaction, customer information will most likely be one of the transferred assets.

It is possible that a child may impersonate a company representative and attempt to apply for a Card and, in so doing, provide the childâ€™s name, address, phone number, fax number, email address and other identifying information. When such information is received and we are aware that the individual providing the information is a child, the information is used only to reject the childâ€™s application and is immediately deleted by us. WEX cannot always determine if a visitor to its website/app or the sender of an email is a child.
